# NodeGui classes

These classes implement NodeGui JS classes, that are in turn based on QT.

This framework allows you to easily create multi-platform desktop apps with a GUI,\
that are more performant and memory efficient than Electron.

*Note*:\
Currently, only the minimal number of NodeGui classes and methods are implemented\
to support the NodeGui example app. More to come..!

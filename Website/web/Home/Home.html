				<p><b>SmallJS</b> is a free and open source implementation of the elegant and powerful Smalltalk-80 (ST)
					language.
					It compiles to JavaScript (JS) that runs in modern browsers or in Node.js.
				</p>
				<p>
					SmallJS is file based, not image based, so you can develop in your favorite IDE.
					The default setup is for Visual Studio Code, with ST syntax coloring and step debugging!
					You code separately from the SmallJS base libraries (image) and only the parts you use are imported
					automatically when running your app.
				</p>
				<p>
					SmallJS is <i>fully</i> object oriented, so customizable on every level.
					For usability, ST class and method names are kept mostly equal to their familiar JS counterparts.
					JS libraries already encapsulated in ST are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Browsers: Document, Window, HTML elements, events, CSS, streams.</li>
					<li>Node.js: HTTP server, Express, 4 databases, files, multi-threading.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					To get you started quickly, there are several example projects.

				<p>SmallJS is targeted at new and experienced developers that want to
					learn a more elegant language than JavaScript and use it to (incementally) build front end and
					back-ends apps with it.</p>

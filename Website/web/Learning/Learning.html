				<p>If you're new to the wonderfully elegant Smalltalk language,
					it's probably a good idea to study one or more of these resources. </p>
				<p>It's best to first try these tutorials in the Smalltalk implementations they are written for,
					because in SmallJS, the names of classes and methods are based on their JS equivalents,
					not on the Smalltalk-80 standard.</p>
				<p>You can then also appreciate the different approach of SmallJS compared to
					image-based Smalltalk implementations with and integrated IDE.</p>

				<p>The SmallJS syntax is mostly compatible with Smalltalk-80<br>
					Some keywords have been added to allow it to be file based and call JS functions.

# Deploying a SmallJS app

To deploy MyApp, you only need to copy the following files:
	- All single files from the root folder.
	- The ..\\Smalltalk folder with the runtime and ST packages you need. \
	   Need: MyApp.js, RunTime.js, Core.js, Dom.js (probably) .\
	   Don't need: Test*.js, Browser.js (unsafe!), CompiledClassesJson.js .

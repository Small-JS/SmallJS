# The Smalltalk language

[Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) (ST) is a pure object oriented programming language, create by researchers at Xerox PARC.
The complete version was released as Smalltalk-80 in 1980.
What separates ST from other languages is its pure object orientation (OO),
compared to other languages where OO was 'bolted on later'. This happened in most of the languages that are widely used today, like JavaScript...

Everything in ST is an object, including integers, strings and ST classes themselves. Objects *only* communicate by sending messages to each other. This allows ST to be readable, compact and elegant while maintaining maximum flexibility at every level.

## SmallJS

So why make SmallJS, when there are already good and free Smalltalks out there? The short answer is: web development. In a web front-end, you eventually will have to run some form of JavaScript. Transpiling elegant Smalltalk to it, will shield you from JS's quirks. And wouldn't it be nice to also use that same language in the back-end, that runs in Node.js? With SmallJS you can.\
These presentation slides go into it in more detail: [Why_SmallJS.pdf](Why_SmallJS.pdf)

This presentation was given live at the UKSTUG online meetup on 26-Feb-2025.\

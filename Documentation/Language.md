# The Smalltalk language

[Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) (ST) is a pure object oriented programming language, create by reserchers at Xerox PARC.
The complete version was released as Smalltalk-80 in 1980.
What separates ST from other languages is its pure object orientation (OO),
compared to other languages where OO was 'bolted on later'. This happened in most of the languages that are widely used today, like JavaScript...

Everything in ST is an object, including integers, strings and ST classes themselves. Objects *only* communicate by sending messages to each other. This allows ST to be readable, compact and elegant while maintaining maximum flexibility at every level.

## SmallJS design improvements over JavaScript / DOM / HTML

Documents perceived design flaws in JavaScript / DOM / HTML.
These can be a basis for implementing cleaner structures in SmallJS, maintaining functionality.
When implementing cleaner structures would deviate too far from expected JS / DOM behavior,
no optimization will be provided, and that choice will be documented here.

# JavaScript

- Numbers are always floats, with some test for "integer floats".\
	ST: Implement integers separate from floats.
- BitInts are limited in use and are treated very differently from Numbers\
	ST: Implement LargeInteger class in unified Magnitude hierarchy
		with automatic scaling between small and large integers.
- The value "undefined" is returned for methods that do not return a specific value, preventing message chaining.\
	ST: Return 'self' ('this') as default for easier message changing.
	ST: Use ';' operator to ignore unneeded return values.
	ST: Always return self when no return value is created. (Don't return an unchanged argument as a pass-through.)
- JS deals with screen coordinates a lot, put does not have an Point class.
	ST: Implement Point class and use this iso passing around separate X and Y coordinates.
- JS has different classes for rectangles, with "loose" x, y and w, h coordinates.
	ST: Implement single Rectangle class using Point objects for origin and extent.
- JS methods can have substantially different behavior depending on argument types given.
	ST: Implement these behaviors as separate methods with clear names.
- JS has 'null' and 'undefined' which is unnecessary and requires extra checking.
	ST: Implement both as 'nil'.

# JS async / await

Unfortunately, JS only allows using 'await' in functions that are directly marked as 'sync'.
There is no way around this with a library solution.
Not having 'await' is very inconvenient for sequential operations on external resources,
like database batch operations (it can result in  "callback hell").
Therefore SmallJS implements the optional 'async' keyword preceding methods definitions
and the 'await' keyword can be used before any object-message send.

# DOM / HTML

- Using different string type DOMString makes things complex.\
	ST: Implement all behaviors in single String class.
- Using different list, map and iterator types makes things complex.\
	ST: Implement all behaviors in Array and Map (todo) class.\
	Note: Iterating over live HTML lists is not implemented yet.
- Having separate 'tree element' abstract base classes Node and Element is unneeded.\
	ST: No solution, is too embedded in the whole DOM.
- Having separate document classes Document, DocumentFragment, ShadowRoot seems unneeded.\
	ST: No solution, is too embedded in the whole DOM.
- JS dynamic import() function does not support modules.\
	Needed when evaluating ST expressions.\
	ST: Workaround by adding a script node to the current document and starting that.

# Frequencies tutorial app

This project is a SmallJS implementation of a simple letter freqency counter app,
that displays the results in a HTML table.

In the [SmallJS Tutorial](https://small-js.org/Tutorial), 
the section "Browser App" shows how to build this app step by step,
starting from the example app Counter.\
This project is the completed result of you only want to *read* though the tutorial.

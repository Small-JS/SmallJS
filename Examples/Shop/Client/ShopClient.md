# Shop client example application

This project is the client side of a very simple example web shop.
It connects to the Shop server application, that must be started first.

## Running

Set up  the server first, see: [../Server/ShopServer.md](../Server/ShopServer.md).\
Then start the server with `./startServer.sh` form this folder,
so that the correct client version is served.

You can select a supported browser in the VSCode debug configuration.
The default login is user "John" with password "secret", already filled in.

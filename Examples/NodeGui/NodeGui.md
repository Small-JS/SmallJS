# NodeGui example app

NodeGui is a Node.js library that encapsulates the multi-platform Qt GUI library.\
It enables you to make performant multi-platform, memory efficient desktop apps\
that are easier to implement than Electron apps.

The trade-off is that Qt widgets are different from HTML elements,\
though most styling of them can be done through farmiliar CSS.

## Running

Just open the file `NodeGui.code-workspace` with VSCode and press `[F5]`.

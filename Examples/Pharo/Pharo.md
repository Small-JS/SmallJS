# Pharo Smalltalk example server app with SmallJS client

This an example app with a Pharo webserver back-end \
and a standard SmallJS browser front-end.\
Communication is done through regular web API calls,\
so no framework expansions are be needed on either side.

The goal is to provide a quick-start environment for existing Pharo users\
that want to have a more native front-end development experience,\
as an alternative to using bridging functionality like PharoJS.
